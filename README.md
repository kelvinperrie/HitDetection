# HitDetection

How does a complex object know when it has been intercepted by another object (like a thing being shot by a bullet)? How about we draw shapes representing a complex object then we can check to see if the point is inside them or not. We can put an image on the complex object later.

Drawing a complex object with shapes, the mouse is like the bullent which intercepts them, the bits that are hit go red

Now the complex object is moving

Now the complex object can shoot, but maths is hard ...
